# Advanced SQL: Complex Queries, Indexing and Optimization

Join is a type of complex query. Complex queries are multiple operations involving joins, subqueries, aggregations and functions to retrieve and manipulate data of tables.

- Joins - Combine rows of 2 or more tables based on related columns

1. Inner join - Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
2. Left join - Retrieves all records from left table with matching records in right table
3. Right join - Retrieves all records from the right table with matching records from the left table
4. Full Outer Join - Retrieves records when there is a match in either table.

## Types of CQ

- Subqueries

This a query nested within another SQL query

### Types of SQ

1. Correlated Subquery - A subquery that refrences columns from the outer query.
2. Non-correlated subquery - A subquery that functions independently of the outer query.
